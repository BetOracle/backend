# API Setup Guide (Deprecated)

This file is deprecated to avoid duplicated documentation.

Use these instead:

- `docs/DATA_SOURCES.md` for API keys and configuration (mock vs real).
- `docs/DEPLOY_RENDER.md` for production deployment.
- `docs/FRONTEND_API.md` for frontend request/response contracts.
